Interactive GLSL Shader with React Three Fiber

<!--- ![Preview]() -->

## Overview

This project is a modern web adaptation of a GLSL shader originally inspired by [M√•rten R√•nge](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/msVBzm). It demonstrates ray marching techniques to render a dynamic scene featuring a lorenz attractor within a plane.

## Shader Breakdown

### Techniques

1. **Ray Marching**:
    - Calculates the intersection of rays with a sphere defined by a signed distance function (SDF).
2. **Tone Mapping**
